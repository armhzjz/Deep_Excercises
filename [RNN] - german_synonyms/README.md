## About <a name = "about"></a>

In this project, I am creating a word embedding on the german languange. This word embedding will be used to measure the cosine similarity of any given word (of the german language) to other vector representations of words in the embedding. In other words, this project aims to provide synonyms of words in the german language.

The word embedding is trained on the novel "Anna Karenina" from Leo . Tolstoi.
