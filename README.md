# Project Title

## About <a name = "about"></a>

In this repository I just want to collect simple and easy deep learning excersices.
All kind of examples for beginners from which one can take one or two tricks are intended to be here.
Since the idea is to precisely have 'easy and simple' examples, they will be no documented nor explained at large, so the reader will have to go through the notebooks and code.
